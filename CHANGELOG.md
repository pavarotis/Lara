## v1.0 — E-Commerce Platform

**Στόχος**: Μετατροπή σε CMS-first πλατφόρμα με block-based content editor, media library, RBAC, και plugin system.

**Overview**: `project-docs/v2/v2_overview.md` — Architecture, strategy & technical specs  
**Migration Guide**: `project-docs/v2/v2_migration_guide.md` — Step-by-step migration  
**Detailed Sprints**: `project-docs/v2/sprints/` — Individual sprint files with detailed tasks

**Documentation Created** (2024-11-27):

- ✅ Updated all references in README.md, CHANGELOG.md, and sprint files
- ✅ Deleted `project-docs/steps_versions/v2_steps.md` (replaced by v2_overview.md)

**Architecture Decision: Hybrid Admin Panel** (2024-11-27):

## Sprint 0 — Review & Fixes (Master DEV)

### Fixes (2024-11-27)
- [x] **BUG FIX**: Component wrappers (`public-layout.blade.php`, `admin-layout.blade.php`) χρησιμοποιούσαν `@include` αντί για proper Blade component classes

  - Διαγράφηκαν τα λανθασμένα blade wrapper files
  - Τώρα το `<x-public-layout>` και `<x-admin-layout>` δουλεύουν σωστά με `$slot`
